# Cybersecurity Query Showcase 🛡️

Welcome! This repository contains a curated collection of my hands-on query work across industry-standard platforms used in cybersecurity analytics and threat detection:

- **Splunk SPL**
- **Microsoft Sentinel KQL**
- **Power Query M Language**

The goal is to demonstrate practical, reusable, and modular queries I’ve built or adapted as part of incident response, SOC operations, and proactive threat hunting initiatives.

## 📂 Query Categories

Each language-specific folder includes queries grouped by purpose:
- `threat_hunting` – Active detection of adversary TTPs
- `operations` – Monitoring and SIEM tuning
- `dashboards/workbooks/reports` – Visualization layers for decision makers

## ✅ Highlights

- ✅ Real-world detection logic
- ✅ Readable and commented queries
- ✅ Security use case driven
- ✅ Modular and scalable
